## Pros and cons of TDD
### Pros 
1. TDD improves the overall code quality because tests are written prior to the actual implementation of the code, the code would e more maintainable and modular afterwards.
2. TDD gives the developer a better visualization of how the code is structure because the tests serve as documentation for the modular code.

### Cons
1. TDD leads to maintenance overhead of the application. This is because as code might be evolving overtime, the tests need to be maintained and revised accordingly.
2. TDD is time-consuming at the beginning, before the actual code is implemented, which increases the initial development time.
